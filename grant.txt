Hi XXX.

I am attempting to start a startup company.  To that end I am applying for a grant https://www.jobsfornsw.com.au/our-products/minimum-viable-product.

We have already secured the initial funding of $20k (aud), for our grant application we need an expression of interest/letter of support from a third party.  If this grant is successful, there is a further development grant available for $100k (AUD).

Could you provide this letter of support ? My understanding is that this commits you, the third party, to provide feedback/input into how the software works and what can be improved.  Exact info I need to submit is in attached grant.jpg.

We so far have a website, 50% complete prototype, email and a correctly registered Australian company:
https://metriculous.network/
https://metriculous.network/screenshots
email : support@metriculous.network

The grant would be used to finish the prototype, improve/completely redesign website and try to get some customers!  There is one competitor to this product as far as I know, gitprime, they have < 20 customers and charge $800+(usd) a month for a one license.

The software itself analyzes GIT commit history and presents the data in a friendly/graphical manner.  If you need any further details, or would like me to draft the support email let me know.

If you are not interested, no worries! Thanks for reading anyway.  Say hi if you are ever in Australia - XXX.

Regards,
Stephen Batty.
